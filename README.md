# Tensoflow-Iris-dataset
Tensorflow Project
This is a simpe tensorflow project where I compare the result between DNN decision neural network classifier 
and RN rndon forest classifier ie Deep learning vs Machine learning . Results are pretttry accurate using both
methin because we have such a small amout of data.
