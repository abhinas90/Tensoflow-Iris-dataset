# Tensoflow-Iris-dataset
Tensorflow Project
This is a simple tensorflow project where I compare the result between DNN decision neural network classifier 
and RN randon forest classifier i.e Deep learning vs Machine learning . Results are pretty accurate using both
methods because we have such a small amout of dataset.
